# Cursed fire, or is C preprocessor Turing-complete?

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to write fully functional code using only the `#define` directive in C?
It's well-known that the C++ templates are Turing-complete, developers write [ray tracers](https://github.com/tcbrindle/raytracer.hpp) that do all evaluations at compile time (instead of runtime).
What about the C preprocessor? As it turns out, the question is a bit more complex than one might think.
To manage expectations, there won't be any ray tracers, but you'll see a lot of cursed code.

First of all, why do I raise the question? If a common computer graphics code bores you, you can skip the next section and scroll straight to the last animation.

## The most mundane fire, non-cursed yet

In fact, recently I promised to write a simple, yet quite [rich compiler for the *wend* language](../../compiler/) that I just invented over the weekend.
Although it's easy to code, it's harder to *describe*.
A good description needs vibrant examples.
I'm allergic to code examples like calculating Fibonacci numbers.
For crying out loud! Since *wend* is pretty primitive, I need examples that are simple yet still impressive.
Suddenly, remembered the old demoscene!
Let us say, I want a bonfire animation.

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire6.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

It's not all that difficult.
I can't run graphics mode, but my terminal supports the `\033[` escape sequence, so a single `print` instruction is enough to draw the fire!
By the way, I've heard that the Windows terminal also supports the ANSI escape sequences, but I haven't checked it myself.
The technology being sorted out, all that's left to do is write the code.
Since I am only half-crazy, I'll write it first in C, and then translate it (manually) into the *wend* language.
Indeed, my compiler is good, but C offers a greater variety of tools.
In addition to that, my compiler isn't bug-free, and I'm too lazy to chase the issues out.
Of course, it happened to me to come across the GCC bugs, but they're rare and almost extinct.
Let's see how to create such a fire animation, and then we'll get back to the preprocessor and the black magic.
This is what the starting point looks like:

??? example "The starting point"
    ```cpp hl_lines="48-51" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire0.c"
    ```

First, I define the dimensions of my terminal (80x25), then define the 256-color palette array and the `fire` buffer that actually contains the picture of the (future) bonfire.
Then, in the infinite `for(;;)` loop, I render the buffer, where I fill randomly selected pixels with white color.
We obtain quite an expected result:

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire0.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

The white pixels will be sparks of flame.
The sparks cool down pretty quickly while heating the surroundings.
It's easy to simulate: at each new frame, we just blur the picture from the previous frame.
All the code changes will occur inside the block marked as `// rendering body`, and each time I'll highlight the lines that change.
You can find the final code in [my compiler repository](https://github.com/ssloy/tinycompiler/tree/main/test-programs/gfx).

The simplest way to blur a picture is to compute the average value of each pixel in relation to its neighboring pixels.
Virtually all implementations I come across require creating a copy of the entire buffer.
Check it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_blur) for an example.
However, such filters are separable in coordinates, so the blur can be obtained
by two separate [motion blur filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur): one horizontal and the other one vertical.
Let us start with the vertical one (lines 60-62):

??? example "Vertical motion blur"
    ```cpp hl_lines="60-62" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire1.c"
    ```

A three-element ring buffer is all we need: no more copies of the screen buffer.
The code gives the following animation (I slowed down the video a bit to make it clearer):

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

Let's add the horizontal motion blur (lines 63-64), thus making it a box blur:

??? example "Box blur"
    ```cpp hl_lines="60-64" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire2.c"
    ```
<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

The heat from a single pixel quickly spreads out quickly, so it becomes nearly invisible in my palette.
On the first iteration, the white pixel is surrounded by eight black pixels; on the second, all nine pixels have a value of 255/9 = 28, and so on:

```
iteration 1    iteration 2     iteration 3
              0  0  0  0 0    3  6  9  6 3
 0  0  0      0 28 28 28 0    6 12 18 12 6
 0 255 0      0 28 28 28 0    9 18 28 18 9
 0  0  0      0 28 28 28 0    6 12 18 12 6
              0  0  0  0 0    3  6  9  6 3
```

Here, I scattered sparks all over the screen, but in reality, the heat is coming directly from the fire.
Let's fix the code a bit to allow fire pixels to be generated on the bottom line only (lines 66-70):

??? example "Fire bed"
    ```cpp hl_lines="66-70" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire3.c"
    ```

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

The air does not randomly ignite anymore, even if the animation becomes less interesting.
In fact, we forgot about convection!
Let's just scroll the previous frame up one line at each step (lines 60-63):

??? example "Convection"
    ```cpp hl_lines="60-62" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire4.c"
    ```

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>


That looks much more like it!
But our campfire should have embers: sparks usually don't come out of nowhere.
Let's paint the ember bed a permanent color (and thus add heat) to the bottom line of the picture (lines 74-75):

??? example "Ember bed"
    ```cpp hl_lines="74-75" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire5.c"
    ```

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>

That's almost it, but we have too much heat, don't you think?
Let's add a cooling effect as a final touch (lines 70-72):

??? example "Cooling"
    ```cpp hl_lines="70-72" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "cursed-fire/fire6.c"
    ```

<video width="320" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="fire6.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>


Well, that's it, I am happy with the result.
The mundane, non-cursed flame is lit.
I guess we're ready to start translating the code to *wend*, right?
Get ready a machina just around the corner, deus ex parked it for me.

## Deus ex machina
The attentive reader might have noticed that in this demo, I have used the `fire[]` buffer to render the animation,
but my *wend* language doesn't have arrays!
I can't compute pixel colors separately because the heat dissipation (and convection, too) requires the state of neighboring pixels to be known.
No worries, I have functions.
Let's imagine that I need an 8-element array.
We can emulate it using eight different variables and two functions, the getter/setter pair:

```cpp
uint8_t fire0, fire1, fire2, fire3, fire4, fire5, fire6, fire7;

uint8_t get_fire(int i) {
    if (i==0) return fire0;
    if (i==1) return fire1;
    if (i==2) return fire2;
    if (i==3) return fire3;
    if (i==4) return fire4;
    if (i==5) return fire5;
    if (i==6) return fire6;
    if (i==7) return fire7;
}

void set_fire(int i, uint8_t v) {
  [...]
}
```

I omit the setter function because it's structurally similar to the getter.
The code seems trivial, but I've just made a linked list instead of an array.
To get to the 2'000th element, I'll have to do 2'000 comparisons.
It does not really matter, but I dislike it.
We can use a dichotomy to convert linear complexity to logarithmic.

```cpp
uint8_t get_fire(int i) {
    if (i<4) {
        if (i<2) {
            if (i<1) {
                return fire0;
            } else {
                return fire1;
            }
        } else {
            if (i<3) {
                return fire2;
            } else {
                return fire3;
            }
        }
    } else {
        if (i<6) {
            if (i<5) {
                return fire4;
            } else {
                return fire5;
            }
        } else {
            if (i<7) {
                return fire6;
            } else {
                return fire7;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That's better.
This very code pushes me to write the article.
My terminal is 80x25, so I need 2'000 memory cells.
2'048 is very close to 2'000, and it's an exact power of two.
So, I get a minimal overhead and don't have to puzzle over about boundary conditions â€” I can just write a fully-balanced binary search tree.

I could have taken any programming language and generated the right text line.
However, I don't know why, but I decided to write a simple `#define` switch in the source code of fire.
This `#define` might switch between a base array and an emulated array: it would have been an easy way to make sure I didn't mess up anywhere.

I have asked myself: can this function be created using the C preprocessor?
To do that, I'd have to write a recursive `#define`.
Is it possible to do this, and if so, how? Of course, I started googling the question.
And I accidentally stumbled upon a [curious thread](https://cplusplus.com/forum/general/9036/) on cplusplus.com, I've even screenshoted it.

??? quote "Screenshot proof"
    ![](forum.png)

My colleague asked the same question I did. In response, he was told three times that the <em>define</em> recursion was impossible. Mwahaha!
Keep in mind that I'm not the smartest person in the room.
I just found the [right URL](https://github.com/pfultz2/Cloak/wiki/C-Preprocessor-tricks,-tips,-and-idioms) on Stack Overflow and only tried to sum up what I have learned.

## How C preprocessor works, or why macros aren't functions

Let's dig into how the C preprocessor works.
In the above code (bonfire), we've already encountered the `#define WIDTH 80`.
This is quite a standard case to define constants.

By the way, don't do this in C++, `constexpr` is a better option!
Define macros have many unpleasant moments, which can be removed with `constexpr`.
When the lexer encounters the `WIDTH` token, it replaces it with 80 before running the compiler.
Macros can also look function-like.
For example, the famous `#define MIN(X, Y) (((X) < (Y)) ? (X) : (Y))` macro.
Note: don't do it like that! In the third decade of the 21st century, I don't see any reason to continue using code from the 70s.

The "execution," or rather the expansion of macro commands, is purely textual.
The preprocessor doesn't understand the C language.
So, if you give it `MIN(habracadabra, circ][(beg+++))`, it'll happily convert it to `(((habracadabra) < (circ][(beg+++))) ? (habracadabra) : (circ][(beg+++)`! Check it yourself with `gcc -E source.c`.

When we want to use a function-like macro command, and we see the similar syntax, most programmers assume that it behaves like a function too.
It is tempting to think that first we evaluate the arguments and then pass them to the body of the parent macro command.
Nope.
The preprocessor isn't the C language, and macros don't behave that way, and the `MIN(habracadabra, circ][(beg+++))` example is proof of that.

Let me list macro expansion rules in the order in which they're executed:

* casting to string (there's no the `#` operator in the article);
* substituting arguments for parameter names (without expanding the tokens);
* token concatenation (there are numerous `##` operators in the article);
* expanding parameter tokens;
* rescanning and expanding the result.

## These are dark times, or the time has come for the black magic

Let's check the simplest example of tail recursion (in C):
```
void recursion(int d) {
    printf("%d ", d);
    if (d!=0) recursion(d - 1);
}
```

If we call <em>recursion(3)</em>, the screen will display <em>3 2 1 0</em>. We need to learn how to do something like that using only macros. OK, let's go through the ingredients one by one, starting with the simplest and working our way up. We need to know:
<ul class="list-level0 list-bullet">
<li>how to decrement;</li>
<li>how to do conditional branching;</li>
<li>how to check a numeric value for null;</li>
<li>how to make a recursive call.</li>
</ul>
    <h2 id="ID6182913EA7">Decrement</h2>
    Let's start with the first oneâ€”how to decrement. The preprocessor is pretty silly. It just replaces text. This may be annoying, but it also allows you to manipulate parts of expressions if you want to. So, it makes a certain sense.
    The preprocessor doesn't know anything about arithmetic. It just makes text substitutions, which make things a bit tricky. Let's make the first try:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define DEC(n) n â€“ 1
DEC(3)
'
3 - 1</code></pre>
    Just to make things clear, I'll run GCC directly on the code from the command line, so you can see both the code and the preprocessor output. So, the <em>DEC(3)</em> macro command doesn't expand into the desired constant, <em>2,</em> but into the <em>3-1</em> expression.
    No problem, let's be crafty and use the token concatenation.
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define DEC(n) DEC_##n
#define DEC_0 0
#define DEC_1 0
#define DEC_2 1
#define DEC_3 2
DEC(3)
DEC(DEC(3))
'
2
DEC_DEC(3)</code></pre>
    When we expand <em>DEC(3)</em>, the <em>DEC_</em> and <em>3</em> tokens are merged, and a new <em>DEC_3</em> token is created, which is expanded to <em>2</em>. Perfect! However, the trick doesn't work with <em>DEC(DEC(3))</em>. Why? That's why I've listed the rules of macro expansion. Concatenation occurs prior to parameters expansion, so the code actually doesn't do what it looks like at first glance: we merge the <em>DEC_</em> token with the non-expanded text of the <em>DEC(3)</em> parameter, and that's where it stops working. No biggies, it's not too hard to help here: we can just hide the concatenation one level deeper:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define CONCAT(a,b) a##b

#define DEC(n) CONCAT(DEC_,n)
#define DEC_0 0
#define DEC_1 0
#define DEC_2 1
#define DEC_3 2

DEC(3)
DEC(DEC(3))
DEC(DEC(DEC(3)))
&gt; '
2
1
0</code></pre>
    I declare <em>CONCAT</em>, the macro command to merge two tokens, and all problems disappear: decrement operates fine using numeric constants, not expressions. Note: I can't decrement, for example, 4 in this code. It's fair to ask whether reasonable to define a macro command for each numeric value. Short answer: forget about reason when programming without a parser! The detailed answer: in this case, the decrement is based on the depth of recursion. It seldom goes over a dozen or two levels.
    <h2 id="ID8D9DFE38D3">Conditional branching</h2>
    So, we've learned the most important thingâ€”now we can create new tokens by merging pieces, and we can use these tokens as names for other macro commands! In such a case, branching wouldn't be difficult. Let's take a look at the following code:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define IF_ELSE(b) CONCAT(IF_,b)
#define IF_0(i) ELSE_0
#define IF_1(i) i ELSE_1
#define ELSE_0(e) e
#define ELSE_1(e)

IF_ELSE(1)(then body)(else body)
IF_ELSE(0)(then body)(else body)
'
then body
else body</code></pre>
    <em>IF_ELSE</em> is a macro command that takes only 0 or 1 as an argument and generates either the <em>IF_0</em> token or the <em>IF_1</em> token using trivial concatenation. <em>IF_0</em> is a command that generates the <em>ELSE_0</em> tokenâ€”it discarding its own arguments along the way. <em>ELSE_0</em> is just an identity map. Let's follow the whole chain of expanding <em>IF_ELSE(0)(then body)(else body)</em>:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">IF_ELSE(0)(then body)(else body)
IF_0(then body)(else body)
ELSE_0(else body)
(else body)</code></pre>
    The expanding with the 1 argument is pretty similar.
    <h2 id="ID9596B0CBCB">Check for null</h2>
    Now you're experienced metaprogrammers, tempered like a sword, and won't be scared of a simple null check :)
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define SECOND(a, b, ...) b
#define TEST(...) SECOND(__VA_ARGS__, 0)
#define ISZERO(n) TEST(ISZERO_ ## n)
#define ISZERO_0 ~, 1

ISZERO(0)
ISZERO(3)
'
1
0</code></pre>
    Let's get into it. When we expand <em>ISZERO(n)</em>, the first thing we do (again, look at the expansion rule order) is concatenation. In this example, I check <em>ISZERO(0)</em> and <em>ISZERO(3)</em>. In the second case, I generate the <em>ISZERO_3</em> token, but in the first case, I generate <em>ISZERO_0</em>, the name of an already existing macro command! It expands to a list of <em>~,1</em>. This is the key idea: to get something with a comma, we should pass null to the <em>ISZERO</em> command. If we pass any other number, the result will be an inexisting token.
    The rest of the work is handled by the <em>SECOND </em>variadic macro command, which returns its second argument. We know for sure that it'll get at least two arguments as input: <em>ISZERO(3)</em> is expanded into <em>SECOND(ISZERO_3, 0)</em>, which equals 0. Well, <em>ISZERO(0)</em> expands to <em>SECOND(~,1,0)</em> and reduces to 1. The tilde character ~ isn't a magic command; it's just a random piece of text because it may create a syntax error when a bug occurs in our macros.
    <h2 id="ID12FA464A36">Recursion</h2>
    So, we've learned how to decrement, and we've learned how to branch the code by zero. Last leapâ€”let's go! If you've defeated the null check, it means that only the sky is the limit for you.
    It's very important to know that all substitutions in macros happen during the lexer execution <strong>BEFORE</strong> we run a parser. Overall, it's to the parser to handle recursions (hello, Turing completeness in templates). The lexer creators have done a lot to <strong>prevent recursive calls</strong>.
    This is needed to prevent infinite recursion when we expand macros. For example, let's take a look at a case like this:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define FOO F BAR
#define BAR B FOO
 
FOO
BAR
'
F B FOO
B F BAR</code></pre>
    It works like this: the preprocessor knows which macros it expands. If it detects one of the macros again at the expanding stage, it paints it blue (the compiler jargon) and leaves it as it is.
    Let's suppose we want to expand the <em>FOO </em>token. The preprocessor enters the "expanding <em>FOO</em>" state, processes the <em>F</em> token. However, when it expands the <em>BAR</em> macro, it encounters the <em>FOO</em> token again and immediately marks it, banning further expansion. It's pretty much the same story when we expand the <em>BAR</em> macro.
    Now let's cheat a little bit!
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define FOO() F BAR
#define BAR() B FOO

FOO()()()()()()()()()
'
F B F B F B F B F BAR</code></pre>
    Interesting and curious. So, what happened? Something pretty interesting happened: we expanded the <em>FOO</em> macro command to a command with parameters. Let's examine two levels of recursion:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">FOO()()()()()()()()()
F BAR()()()()()()()()
F B FOO()()()()()()() <- there's a non-blueprinted FOO!</code></pre>
    When we see <em>FOO</em> for the second time, the lexer doesn't detect it because the lexer  generated the <em>FOO</em> token <strong>without parameters</strong>. That is the end of the <em>FOO</em> handling. Then the lexer continues working, detects the brackets, and calls <em>FOO</em> for the second time. And then a third time. A fourth time.
    We're getting lucky!
    I remind you that a direct call to <em>FOO()</em> inside <em>BAR</em> doesn't work. We should stop the context of an expanding macro command before we encounter the same macro command token with parameters. And, as it turns out, it's not hard to do. First, let's add an empty macro command, <em>EMPTY()</em>:
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -P -E - <<<'
#define EMPTY()
#define FOO() F BAR EMPTY() ()
#define BAR() B FOO EMPTY() ()

FOO()

#define EVAL(x) x
EVAL(FOO())
EVAL(EVAL(FOO()))
EVAL(EVAL(EVAL(FOO())))
EVAL(EVAL(EVAL(EVAL(FOO()))))
'
F BAR ()
F B FOO ()
F B F BAR ()
F B F B FOO ()
F B F B F BAR ()</code></pre>
    Now, when we try to expand <em>FOO()</em>, the lexer creates the <em>F</em> token and the <em>BAR</em> token that don't match the name of the <em>BAR()</em> macro command. Then the lexer handles the empty token and leaves the brackets <em>()</em> as is. That's it, the <em>FOO()</em> context is done, and nothing has been painted blue. However, <em>FOO()</em> expands to a rather boring <em>F BAR ()</em>, just like before. What do we get? Look further down the code. I define the identity macro command <em>#define EVAL(x) x</em>, and the <em>EVAL(FOO())</em> recursion becomes much more interesting. Let's follow the whole chain (refresh your memory of the expansion rules, especially the last one):
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">EVAL(FOO()) <- enter the EVAL context
FOO()       <- at this stage, the EVAL parameter tokens are recursed
F BAR ()    <- the single EVAL parameter recursed
F B FOO ()  <- RESCAN after EVAL parameters have been recursed!</code></pre>
    Well, that's about it. After wrapping it up in two <em>EVAL</em>s, we're done here. In general, we need about as many <em>EVAL</em> wrappers as there are levels of recursion. This can be provided with just a few lines of code. Let's put it all together. Note that we need to get something similar to the C code but with macro recursion!
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -xc - <<<'
#include <stdio.h&gt;
void foo(int d) {
    printf("%d ", d);
    if (d!=0) foo(d - 1);
}
int main() {
    foo(3);
    return 0;
}
' && ./a.out
3 2 1 0 ssloy@home:~$</code></pre>
    No problem at all! Here are just copy-pasted code snippets. We have to be careful with another level of delay on line 29. The <em>BAR</em> token is generated inside the branching instruction, so we need to wait for one more iteration of <em>EVAL</em> to ensure that <em>BAR</em> isn't blueprinted.
    <pre class="clear"><code class="cpp">ssloy@home:~$ gcc -xc - <<<'

As I promised, the entire frame buffer is stored in a cluster of separate variables; there are no arrays!
    <h2 id="ID508D730597">Is the C preprocessor Turing-complete?</h2>
    The term "Turing-complete" colloquially means that any real general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real general-purpose computer or computer language. No real system can have infinite memory, but if we neglect the memory limitation, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.
    Not only the preprocessor memory is limited, but also the number of token rescanning levels (which we set with <em>EVAL</em>). However, it's just a form of memory limitation, so the preprocessor is quite Turing-complete.
    After I wrote the article, I've found <a href="https://github.com/Hirrolot/metalang99" class="link-outer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">another link to a project</a> where devs have created a programming metalanguage using only definesâ€”it's insane madness. Unfortunately, it's too complicated for the first touch with the b1ack magic of the preprocessor. My tricks can still go into prod, but metalang99's tricksâ€”I doubt it :)
    <h2 id="IDBE357E4259">Bonus level</h2>
    Modern optimizing compilers may be the most complex and impressive creation of humanity in the field of software engineering. However, that's not magic. An ordinary human brain will tell in a few seconds what the below very trivial code should be compiled into, but GCC will need many exabytes of memory and many years to give the answer.
